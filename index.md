# Welcome to XaviSean's Homepage!

This is XaviSean.

I am an undergraduate student in physics major. This homepage contains the course notes of many major physics courses. I sincerely hope my notes help you get interested in physics and comprehend knowledges. I will also be glad if you appreciate my notes, but I will suggest you more to perude the original books if you have enough interests and enough time. 

# Notes

## Quantum Field Theory

<b><a href = "https://xavisean.github.io/Notes_QFT.pdf"> Note: Quantum Field Theory </a></b>

This note of quantum field theory is mainly referred to S. Weinberg's **_The Quantum Theory of Fields_**. The arrangement follows the development of the book. Some contents, including some maths and detailed clarification for particular models, are inserted for necessity. In this book, Weinberg constructs a powerful framework for quantum field theory based on integrated mathematics method and abstract theories. It's OK to encounter absurdities and obstables during reading, but keep in mind to stay patient.

I also highly recommand M. Peskin's **_An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory_** and A. Zee's **_Quantum Field Theory in a Nutshell_**. Both of them are renowned physicists and their works are talented.

## Quantum Mechanics

<b><a href = "https://xavisean.github.io/Note_QM.pdf"> Note: Quantum Mechanics </a></b>

This note of quantum mechanics is mainly referred to R. Shankar's **_Principles of Quantum Mechanics_**. Part of the contents are from J. J. Sakurai's **_Modern Quantum Mechanics_** and X. Ka's **_Advanced Quantum Mechanics （喀兴林，高等量子力学）_**. The pictures in this notes are captured from Wikipedia and S. Brandt & H. Dahmen's **_The Picture Book of Quantum Mechanics_**. 

There are miscellaneous quantum mechanics textbooks. Shankar's book is one of the most praised works. It is firendly to freshmen since it states nearly everything with an extremely lucidity. Similar works like D. Griffiths's **_Introduction to Quantum Mechanics_** are also recommended. 

## Solid State Physics

<b><a href = "https://xavisean.github.io/Note_SolidPhysics.pdf"> Note: Solid State Physics </a></b>

This note of solid state physics is mainly referred to N. W. Ashcroft & N. D. Mermin's **_Solid State Physics_**, S. Yan's **_Foudations of Solid State Physics （阎守胜，固体物理基础）_** and A. Hu's **_Solid State Physics （胡安，固体物理学）_**. Ahercroft & Mermin's book is widely delieved to be the most classical work in solid state physics, to which S. Yan's book heavily refers. 

## Electrodynamics

<b><a href = "https://xavisean.github.io/Note_ED.pdf"> Note: Electrodynamics </a></b>

This note of electrodynamics is mainly referref to J. D. Jackson's **_Classical Electrodynamics_**, which is, in my perspective, the greatest textbook of  electrodynamics ever. I personally love this book because of its clear development and rich contents.

## Photonic Crystal

<b><a href = "https://xavisean.github.io/photonic crystal.pdf"> Photonic Crystal </a></b>

This is an introductory note for photonic crystal and its basic theoretical method. A photonic crystal consists of layers of dielectrics with spatial periodicity. Such a structure defects EM waves with particular frequencies.
