# Welcome to XaviSean's Homepage!

Hello everyone! This is XaviSean.

I am an undergraduate student in physics major. This homepage contains the course notes of many major physics courses. I sincerely hope my notes help you get interested in physics and comprehend knowledges.

# Notes

## Quantum Field Theory

This notes of quantum field theory is mainly referred to Steve Weinberg's **_The Quantum Theory of Fields_**. The arrangement follows the development of the book. Some contents, including some maths and detailed clarification for particular models, are inserted for necessity. In this book, Weinberg constructs a powerful framework for quantum field theory based on integrated mathematics method and abstract theories. It's OK to encounter absurdities and obstables during reading, but keep in mind to stay patient.

Besides, even though I will be glad if you appreciate my notes, I will suggest you more to perude the original book if you have enough interests and enough time. I also highly recommand Michael Peskin's **_An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory_** and Anthony Zee's **_Quantum Field Theory in a Nutshell_**. Both of them are renowned physicists and their works are talented.
